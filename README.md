## Grace Period
In Phasmophobia, there is a grace period based on difficulty based on what difficulty you are on.
This "Grace Period" determines how long before a ghost can enter a Player Hunt.
- Amateur: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Intermediate: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- Professional: 0 seconds (No Grace Period)

However, when using a **Ouija Board** during the Grace Period, there is a 1 in 3 chance that it can end the
Grace Period early.

## Player Sanity
Sanity is a vital mechanic in Phasmophobia. Sanity determines Ghost's chances to hunt.
Below you will find all of the known information about how sanity is drained.
### Drain Per Minute
The information below shows how much is lost per minute when Solo. With a lobby of 2 or more people
these numbers are doubled.
- Small Map: 7.2%
- Medium Map: 4.8%
- Large Map: 3%
### Stopping The Drain
These things have been proven to prevent Sanity depletion.
- Being Outside the Building
- Standing within lights range


## Movement Speeds
Phasmophobia uses a very easy to understand movement system. Below you will see the list of movement speeds per entity.
- Player (Walking): 1.1
- Player (Running): 1.6
- Normal Ghost Hunting: 1.5
- Revenant Hunting (No Target): 1.1
- Revenant Hunting (Targeted): 3.0


## Ghost Hunting
This is the most terrifying part of how Ghosts function. Ghosts can hunt based on certain variables in play; 
such as ghost type, player sanity and several other things. This section here only discusses the mechanics of the Hunt, 
with important things to note linked to other parts of this guide.

### Hunt Duration
Here you will find how long a Hunt actually lasts on each difficulty.
- Amateur: 25 seconds
- Intermediate: 45 seconds
- Professional: 50 seconds

After a Hunt, successful or not, a Ghost cannot Hunt again for another 25 seconds minimum.

### Common Misconceptions
